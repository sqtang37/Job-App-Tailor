        "job_description": "Company Description\n\nToday, when you go to your doctor and get referred to a specialist (e.g., for sleep apnea), your doctor sends out a referral and tells you, “They’ll be in touch soon.” So you wait. And wait. Sometimes days, weeks, or even months. Why? Because too often specialists and medical services are overwhelmed with referrals and the painstakingly manual process it takes to qualify your referral prevents them from getting around to it on time, or sometimes at all.\n\nTennr prevents these delays and denials by making sure every referral gets where it needs to go, with the right info, at the right time. Powered by RaeLM™, Tennr reads, extracts, and acts on every piece of patient information so providers can capture more referrals, slash denials, and reduce delays.\n\nRole Description\n\nThe Data Analyst collaborates with stakeholders across Tennr to provide clarity and insights into how our platform improves pre-visit patient processing for customers. You’ll be responsible for turning raw data into actionable insights that show how Tennr drives outcomes:\n\nConversion — ensuring that more patient referrals actually turn into scheduled visits and care delivered\nDenials — reducing claims denied by payers through cleaner data entry and qualification upfront\nEfficiency — enabling operators to process more referrals, faster, with fewer errors\n\nYou’ll work closely with Product, Engineering, Sales, and Marketing to execute on a wide array of projects, including:\n- Building comprehensive ROI analysis strategies to ensure every customer sees maximal value from Tennr\n- Designing customer health tracking systems that integrate data from Salesforce, Postgres, and RCM systems to predict when customers need attention before they know it themselves\n- Iterating on dashboards that track conversion, denials, and efficiency across Tennr’s product suite — Universal Inbox, Benefits Investigation, Qualification, and Communication Coordination\n- Rolling out new analytics tools that give customers visibility into how Tennr drives results, plus actionable opportunities to amplify those outcomes\n\nResponsibilities\n\n- Develop a deep understanding of how customers run intake, wrangling, eligibility & benefits, qualifications, and revenue cycle management processes — working with our Center of Excellence team to uncover inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement\n- Deliver insights that highlight operational inefficiencies, data entry errors, or workflow issues that CX, Product, or Implementation teams can act on to help improve our customers’ businesses\n- Collaborate with Data Engineers to design and optimize data lake and warehouse architectures that ensure scalability, reliability, and accessibility of analytics across the company\n- Partner with Product, Engineering, Sales, and Marketing to deliver reporting and dashboard needs\n- Design and maintain ETL processes to ensure data accuracy, timeliness, and scalability\n- Own analytics projects from scoping to delivery, ensuring stakeholders get measurable value from your work\n\nCandidate Qualifications\n\nCore Requirements\n- Strong technical skills: SQL, BI tools (Tableau, Sigma, Power BI), Excel, ETL, and basic Python\n- 1+ years of experience in an Analyst role, Software Engineering role, or related work experience\n- Strong communicator: able to turn complex analysis into actionable insights for executives and cross-functional teams\n- Growth mindset: gritty, adaptable, and passionate about learning\n- Autonomy: able to manage projects end-to-end with minimal oversight while aligned with the Analytics Lead\n- Cross-functional operator: skilled at partnering with Implementation, Customer Success, Marketing, Sales, and Product\n- Bias to action: excited to move fast, test ideas, and refine through feedback\n\nNice-to-Haves\n- Experience with Snowflake\n- Familiarity with Salesforce data and reporting\n- Skills in query performance optimization\n- Prior experience with healthcare data, workflows, or RCM systems\n- Customer-facing experience — comfort presenting insights, building ROI cases, or working directly with external stakeholders\n\nWhy Tennr?\n\n- Career Growth: as one of the first analytics hires, you’ll play a foundational role in shaping Tennr’s analytics function, with significant room to grow as the team expands.\n- Drive Impact: one of our company values is Cowboy, meaning you set the pace.

I have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to identify improvement opportunities, quantify before-and-after impacts, and ensure that analytical outputs remain accurate, consistent, and ready for client consumption.\n\nMy scientific research background further strengthens my systematic problem-solving skills. I have worked extensively with large, complex datasets—ranging from nuclear physics databases to multimedia datasets—and applied statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and rigorous validation techniques to derive trustworthy insights. I am confident that these competencies would allow me to effectively support Cognizant’s mapping, data quality, and operational analytics initiatives.\n\nI am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to Cognizant’s onsite team in Bothell, collaborate with advanced operators, and support high-impact analytical solutions that improve productivity across the organization.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my analytical expertise and hands-on experience can support Cognizant’s continued success.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Swati"

        "job_description": "Company Description\n\nToday, when you go to your doctor and get referred to a specialist (e.g., for sleep apnea), your doctor sends out a referral and tells you, “They’ll be in touch soon.” So you wait. And wait. Sometimes days, weeks, or even months. Why? Because too often specialists and medical services are overwhelmed with referrals and the painstakingly manual process it takes to qualify your referral prevents them from getting around to it on time, or sometimes at all.\n\nTennr prevents these delays and denials by making sure every referral gets where it needs to go, with the right info, at the right time. Powered by RaeLM™, Tennr reads, extracts, and acts on every piece of patient information so providers can capture more referrals, slash denials, and reduce delays.\n\nRole Description\n\nThe Data Analyst collaborates with stakeholders across Tennr to provide clarity and insights into how our platform improves pre-visit patient processing for customers.
