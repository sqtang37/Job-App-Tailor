My work has included designing service-oriented and REST-based architectures, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and collaborating closely with stakeholders to translate complex operational needs into reliable, performant systems—experience that aligns closely with Peraton’s focus on supporting combatant command workflows and intelligence missions.\n\nMy technical background includes strong proficiency in Java, Python, and JavaScript, as well as hands-on experience with Spring and modern web frameworks, RESTful APIs, JSON-based integrations, and relational databases such as PostgreSQL and Oracle. I have worked extensively in Linux-based environments and cloud platforms, including AWS, and have leveraged tools such as Git, Jenkins, and GitLab to support collaborative development and automated testing. Throughout my career, I have emphasized documentation, test automation, and integration readiness to ensure systems meet performance, security, and reliability requirements.\n\nIn prior roles at IBM and Resume Worded, I collaborated closely with systems analysts, engineers, and product teams to design and enhance software systems under tight operational constraints. I am comfortable working independently or within Scrum teams, participating in acceptance criteria development, debugging complex issues, and delivering incremental improvements that directly support customer and mission needs. I am also highly motivated to work within defense and intelligence environments and am willing and able to meet clearance requirements associated with this role.\n\nPeraton’s commitment to solving “the can’t be done” challenges strongly resonates with me. I am eager to bring my software engineering expertise, Agile mindset, and dedication to operational excellence to support Intelligence Community customers and contribute to mission success.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills can support Peraton’s critical national security programs.\n\nSincerely,\nPeter Sash"}

With over seven years of professional software engineering experience and a strong foundation in systems architecture, backend development, and performance-critical systems, I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to high-fidelity radar simulation and digital twin environments that support Lockheed Martin’s mission-critical platforms.\n\nIn my previous roles as a Senior Software Engineer and Systems Architect, I have designed, implemented, and maintained large-scale software systems that operate as part of complex, distributed environments. I have extensive experience building and integrating backend engines, designing modular and maintainable codebases, and working across system boundaries—skills that directly translate to developing radar modeling, signal processing, and control components within a system-of-systems architecture.\n\nWhile my recent work has been applied in enterprise and e-commerce environments, it required many of the same core engineering principles critical to radar simulation software: strong object-oriented design, performance awareness, rigorous testing, and careful integration with external systems. I have worked extensively with C# and Python, and I am comfortable applying these object-oriented and systems-level concepts in C++, particularly in environments where correctness, performance, and reliability are paramount.\n\nI bring a systems-engineering mindset to my work, regularly collaborating with technical leads and cross-functional teams to translate high-level requirements into actionable development tasks. I have actively participated in design reviews, code reviews, and Agile ceremonies, and I place strong emphasis on maintainability, regression testing, and continuous improvement of legacy codebases. My experience deploying and operating software on Linux-based systems further supports my ability to deliver robust solutions in simulation and modeling environments.\n\nI am particularly drawn to this role because it combines software engineering with system-level analysis and real-world impact. I am eager to deepen my work in modeling, simulation, and signal-centric systems, and to contribute to radar technologies that directly support national security missions. Lockheed Martin’s emphasis on technical excellence, collaboration, and long-term innovation strongly aligns with my professional goals.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background in software engineering and systems architecture can support the Radar Modeling and Simulation team at Lockheed Martin.\n\nSincerely,\nKatie Lee"}
